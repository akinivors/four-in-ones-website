# Dental Grid Images - TODO

## Required Images
You need to add 10 images to the `/public/images/dental-grid/` folder:

1. `implants.jpg` - Dental implants procedure
2. `bleaching.jpg` - Teeth whitening/bleaching
3. `prosthetic.jpg` - Prosthetic dentistry (crowns, veneers)
4. `removable.jpg` - Removable dentures
5. `surgeries.jpg` - Dental surgeries
6. `orthodontics.jpg` - Braces and aligners
7. `pediatric.jpg` - Children's dentistry
8. `periodontology.jpg` - Gum treatment
9. `restorative.jpg` - Fillings and restorations
10. `endodontics.jpg` - Root canal treatment

## Image Specifications
- Format: JPG recommended
- Size: Approximately 400x400px minimum
- Aspect Ratio: Square or close to it works best
- Quality: High quality, professional dental photography

## Temporary Solution
Until you add real images, you can use placeholder images or the component will show broken image icons. The component will still function - clicking categories will show the procedure lists below.

## How to Add Images
1. Save your dental procedure images with the exact filenames listed above
2. Place them in: `/public/images/dental-grid/`
3. Refresh the cosmetic dentistry page to see them
